            I'm Phureewat Aphibansri, I work full-time as a game programmer at&nbsp;
            <mdx.a href="https://secret6.com">Secret 6, Inc</mdx.a>. In my free
            time, I study front-end development with React. My goal is to write
            useful apps and contribute to open source projects while working a
            full-time job.

          <mdx.h3>Why make this website?</mdx.h3>
          <mdx.p>
            I made this website to learn what actually goes into web
            development. From planning, design, development, launch, and
            maintenance. For sure there are other things that I have yet to
            encounter, and Iâ€™m ready to learn them. This also serves a
            motivation for me to continue making projects because now I finally
            have a place to showcase them.
